      <p>
        I am an artist, a writer, a designer, and a soon to be coder. I see all four practices as related. I enjoy the
        creativity they encourage and the challenges they provide. Whether it's with ink, or words, or code, I'm using
        my mind and my hands to create and to build something, and that I is what I love to do most. I am most drawn to
        projects that work to create positive social and/or environmental impact. I have worked for a company in the
        holistic medicine industry and am currently designing for a start-up which promotes cultural exchange.

        Other interesting things about me include my identical twin sister for whom I plan to create a portfolio
        website if she illustrates my as yet unpublished (must finish them first) novels, my extensive collection of
        travel anecdotes, and my penchant for volunteering for non-profits. I also like buying too many books and
        hanging out with cats.
